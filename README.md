# classifiySleepingStagePersons
we take dataset from mne library in python , this dataset about measure a signals for sleeping person 
in this notebook we get the dataset and apply som features
features 
   1. mean 
   2. spectral entropy
   3. moment 2 3
   4. bands [delta- theta - alpha - beta -gamma]

then in the second notebook we take signals about 21 sleeping person and apply extract features of it then apply classification to detect the stage of sleeping person then check the important features for each classifier 

classifciation 
   1.RandomForestRegressor
   2.DecisionTree
   3.KNN
   4.Logistic Regression
   5.SVM
